# Designing_a_secure_network

## Project Context:

Your company faces an exciting challenge: designing a secure and efficient network for a client relocating to a new office. Their current setup requires modernization, and you're tasked with crafting a cost-effective, well-structured plan that optimizes resource allocation while adhering to stringent security best practices.

## Pedagogical Approach:

Network Simulation: We'll leverage Cisco Packet Tracer to visualize and test our network design: https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer.
Structured Documentation: Clear and comprehensive documentation will accompany the network plan, ensuring future maintainability.
Security Focus: Security considerations will be prioritized throughout the design process, implementing robust measures to protect network assets.
Justified Design: Our presentation will present our design choices and explain their rationale, demonstrating critical thinking and understanding.
Evaluation Criteria:

Network Functionality: Does the Packet Tracer simulation demonstrate robust connectivity and performance?
Documentation Clarity: Is the network documentation thorough, understandable, and well-structured?
Security Strength: Have appropriate security measures been implemented to address potential threats?
Deliverables:

Packet Tracer Network: Share your network configuration file for evaluation.

Comprehensive Documentation: Create a detailed PDF or Word document describing the network design, including:

- Network diagram with annotations.
- IP addressing table per sector and VLAN (if used).
- Configuration details for key devices.
- Explanation of security measures and their purpose.
- Cost breakdown of network components.
- Group Presentation: Deliver a 10-minute presentation explaining your design choices and security considerations. Ensure all team members participate.

Constraints and Requirements:

Firewall Simulation: While Packet Tracer may not fully support advanced firewall configuration, we'll implement alternative security measures (explained later).

Client Requirements:

- Active Directory and DNS server
- DHCP server
- DMZ concept implemented through VLANs and access control lists (ACLs) (firewall alternative)
- iSCSI storage server
- Four network sectors:
  Management/Secretariat (5 workstations)
  Study (8 workstations)
  Production (10 workstations)
  Support (2 sectors, 10 workstations each)
