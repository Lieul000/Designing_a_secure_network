# Designing_a_secure_network
Your company faces an exciting challenge: designing a secure and efficient network for a client relocating to a new office. Their current setup requires modernization, and you're tasked with crafting a cost-effective, well-structured plan that optimizes resource allocation while adhering to stringent security best practices.

Constraints and Requirements:

Firewall Simulation: While Packet Tracer may not fully support advanced firewall configuration, we'll implement alternative security measures (explained later).

Client Requirements:

Active Directory and DNS server
DHCP server
DMZ concept implemented through VLANs and access control lists (ACLs) (firewall alternative)
iSCSI storage server
Four network sectors:
Management/Secretariat (5 workstations)
Study (8 workstations)
Production (10 workstations)
Support (2 sectors, 10 workstations each)
